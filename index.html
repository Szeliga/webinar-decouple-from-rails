            I would like to say upfront, that this presentation is a work in progress.
            While I was working on it a buttload of topics popped into my head, that I could talk about.
            But if I would incorporate of all those ideas, we would be sitting here the whole weekend.
            At the end I will share with you my plans for the future of this presentation.

            how all the proposed solutions are implemented, in a very simple and naive example, but it will get the job done

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Form objects are your domain models, they are first-class citizens, so treat them that way,
                and not as slaves to your ActiveRecord models</p>
              <p>All data validation should happen in the form object, you ActiveRecord models should only contain relationship definitions</p>
              <p>Also don't think of your form objects as something that is tightly coupled to an HTML form,
                a form object doesn't have to be rendered as a form. It can come from GET params
                or a message broker, or anything else that has contact with the outside world</p>

            <h2>Performing work</h2>
            <p>This is the heart of the feature/use case/user story - use a/an action/interactor/command/use case/omgwtfbbq pattern</p>
            <small class="fragment">This is a service object only in tutorial applications!</small>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>This is the main action of your feature, it will delegate validation of the input
                to the form object, and implement the main algorithm, that will process the validated input
                and persist it, or build a query based on it, or perform any other sort of actions</p>

              <p>Service objects should implement a single unit of work, and be as simple as possible.
                Instead they tend to be the new fat controller/fat model - the bulk of the code is just shifted into a new object
                You should use service objects inside your actions to divide the work done there,
                you can even organise them into composites that share a common interface - this additionally helps writing better unit tests</p>

              <p>Using actions also allows you to move away from factories in test.
                Factories are bad because they create the state of the application in a way
                that is not present anywhere in the app, it is artificial and will result in bugs</p>

              <p>We can run a whole action in a setup block to create the desired state of the app</p>

            This file structure is strongly opinionated.
            I find it's easier to structure your code this way,
            because you don't have to browse in 8 different directories in order to comprehend the feature they implement.

            I also think this somehow forces me to write classes following the SRP principle (this is just my opinion)

              So this is our example controller action, as the name states, it has to do with user registration, so what do we have here?
              Right off the bat you can see that there is not an ounce of business logic, or params validation, or even a stupid if statement.
              We delegate this stuff to the action object, and call a couple of methods on it

              This is how a basic action get's instantiated. It requires the request params.
              I'm sure you've noticed that there are no strong parameters present here, no permit, no nothing.
              That's because, this is not the place for that, our controller action only cares about rendering and redirecting,

              This is the basic way to run an action. We use the .on method to tell the action
              what to do when a particular result is reached.<br>
              The controller action doesn't care about if the action was successful, so it doesn't ask it that (well it does but not in that meaning).<br>
              It just tells the action object that do perform x in case of y, perform z in case of w etc.<br>

              The .on method comes from a gem called whisper, but this is a very simple callback mechanism that can be implemented on your own.
              You will see how a specific callback is being executed in a sec<br>

              The method function you see here, looks for a method named as the passed symbol and return a ruby Method class instance.
              This instance behaves like a lambda/proc, we can convert it to a proc with & and pass it to the action, and the wisper gem takes care of the rest

              For each anticipated result from the action we can have a proper method.
              In this example we want to differentiate the registration failure from registration disabled (by a feature flag perhaps?)
              and perform different things (a very lame example but you get the point)<br>

              So what's good about this example? It is very confident, we don't go paranoid and ask the action if it finished, how did it finish
              and we don't write a bunch of if statements to act accordingly.<br>

              Here we simply say to the action 'Yo, do this in case of success, failure and disabled'

              Granted, this is a very simple action, but it demonstrates how much better our code can be.
              We can easily identify what this action does precisely, all we have here is pure business logic,
              no data validation logic, no rails-specific logic like rendering and redirecting.

              The form method could be refactored to the abstract action and use some metaprogramming magic to infer the proper class name
              based on the action it is used in. But I find that being explicit is often better, when we come back to this code in a year (or someone else is assigned to it),
              we won't be figuring out where the hell did this form object come from

              Execute is our main part of the actions public interface, it implements the algorithm that is our feature.

              This implementation in particular checks if our registration disabled flag is on, if yes it boradcasts the disabled event,
              which causes our controller to act on it because we told it to. The broadcast method is part of the whisper gem
              we can wrap this in a different alias method like result! in our Abstract::Action.
              This way we provide an adapter for the gem and refactor the gem to something else in only one place, instead of every action

              Next it asks the form if the data we assign to it is valid, if yes, proceed with the user creation and return

              In the event that something breaks during validation we broadcast the failure result with the form object in question, so it can be rendered

              We can easily see that this logic is starting to get a little hard to follow, someone adds some more data manipulation here
              and a we have a code disaster at our hands.

              Don't get me wrong, it is a bad habit to optimize stuff early and try to predict the future in the code, because it will almost never be correct,
              but when someone sees this code structure, a nice division of responsibilities, he will think twice before dumping additional logic here
              and will think that maybe this needs extracting into a Builder object? (if that person does dump additional logic without thinking twice, then archivize)

              Also we can see that we are not relying on the form object to perform the data persistance, because it is not it's responsibility!
              It is bad enough that it is responsible for rendering and validating stuff

            * this is in fact something that I wanted to do in the beginning, so I don't preach about theoretical stuff,
              but that took too much time to finish, so I decided to keep this as a follow up to this presentation <br>
            * there are a couple of design patterns that I use in everyday work, like the Builder, Factory, Composite, Facade, Decorator, Proxy, Strategy
              and I would love to talk about them more <br>
            * in this presentation I only touched upon the Single Responsibility Principle (S in SOLID) (maybe because it's the easiest to understand)
              but the remaining four are also a very important part of object oriented programming and definetely deserve a presentation of their own
              especially in a Rails application context (this may prove hard to do, seeing as I'm still getting familiar with SOLID)
